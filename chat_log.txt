✅ Question: what is Samsung's revenue in the year 2024?
Answer: I cannot give you exact revenue figures for Samsung's entire year 2024. This is because:

   The year 2024 is not yet over: Final revenue figures for a fiscal year are typically only published after the year ends and the annual report is prepared.
   Revenue figures are confidential: Companies like Samsung typically publish quarterly and annual reports, but detailed internal revenue figures are often not publicly accessible.

Where you could find information:

   Samsung Investor Relations: Samsung's investor relations page is the best place to look for official financial reports once they are published.
   Financial news and analysis: Follow news agencies and financial analysts covering Samsung. They will analyze and comment on the revenue figures once they are available.
